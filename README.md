i follow people who have cool repositories / rentrys / atabooks / whtever!

quick rundown of ponytown stuff because, uh, i dunno. if you want info about me check either of these rentrys [1](https://rentry.co/inthelittlewood) [2](https://rentry.co/pawpertypolice) 
(the 2nd has more info overall)

- i'm often offtab! if you want my attention/give a crown please do it in whisper.
- i am terribly anxious of public chat and prefer whispers/party, although i try my best!
- i get drained real easily and am terribly awkward. if you're a friend (/green name) & i'm around feel free to say hi!! i can't guarantee i'll be up to talking.
- i'm almost always willing to chat! i may come off as uncomfortable or dry but i just struggle w/ talking overall.
- (related to above point) feel free to interact whenever! unless i have any form of dni in my pony name. i don't change the status often.
- (related to above point again) i take a WHILE to warm up to people, but when i do i am Terribly active & talkative!
- (ok ALSO related to above point) i mistype a Lot. both on purpose & on accident. if it gets annoying just mention it & i'll try my best to catch any mistakes.
- i don't usually accept random friend requests, perosnal comfort! if we've talked before maybe i'll accept.
- feel free to give crowns! i try to respond to them but i don't always. i appreciate them all though o7
- i'd rather not have people directly copy my ponies, but inspiration is ok!
- c+h is always ok, esp. if matching fandom ponies! :-)

also, i'm not gonna put a dni list here (use [system dni](https://rentry.co/grumbomb) for that) but a quick interact with caution list w/ short explanations
- skizz fans (recent situations, may be removed/enforced depending on whatever happens in the future)
- DDVAU/double hearted fans (overall just bad experiences w/ fans)
- heavy scar/grian shippers (NOTHING WRONG WITH SCARIAN! another overall bad experience w/ fans)
- flower husband (jim/scott) shippers (same as above 2 but because of stuff that happened to my friend)
- anti joelshipping/lizzieshipping (i do both occasionally , altho i don't talk abt it)

this'll be updated occasionally... i don't know how often but i'll try to keep it updated!
