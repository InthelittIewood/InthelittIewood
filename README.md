martyns terribly long & messy github repository: pony town edition <br>
except its not really a pony town edition its just the default one <br>
made for pony town. so. technically pony town edition
***
## GENERAL INFO (i tried my best to simplify all this):
martyn, neil, or jeanine (in order of preference). any pronouns but i heavily prefer she/her & ae/aers. <br>
[thou/thee](https://pronouny.xyz/pronouns/601da3941d17f10013457879) instead of you/your is also funny and i like it. you don't need to use them tho <br>
my identity is very much a mess but to simply put it: i am a trans objectum lesboy freak <br>
bodily white & very much disabled. body age is n/a on account of i'm ant!

i'm both an introject (3rd life martyn) & the host of a (polyfragmented) system. <br>
i don't really care about 'doubles' or whatever and uhh. source talk ok <- mcyt sp/interest <br>
i'm not always fronting so um . thumbs up! if you're not sure just bap (whisper) <br>
^ usually if a different github is linked (renchanting, thesunlandictwins) then its probably not me

uhhh I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO PUT HERE help. this is the general... gist of it.... shrugs

## "INTERACT WITH CAUTION" (not a dni list):
quick list! anything in parentheses are simple reasons why. IWC/ thin ice?? i guess.
- skizz fans ([this twitter account](https://x.com/SkizzleArchive) is worth looking at, but the general idea is MAGA mods) (that he is actively friends with)
- doc fans (general dislike for him, also was. terribly childish about something)
- DDVAU/double hearted fans (personal dislike & opinions on the comic, also that "all cops are beautiful" shit about hotguy) (fuck off if you were doing that!)
-  **heavy** scarian (scar/grian) shippers (bad experiences, just be normal please)
-  **heavy** ranchers (tango/jimmy) shippers (same as above)
-  flower husbands (scott/jimmy) shippers (bad experiences, also a lot of you are just. annoying. and fairly rude) (Not all of you just. a Loud minority)
-  anti joelshippers / lizzieshippers (I DO BOTH!! i just am not loud about it)
-  scott/pearl, scott/woman shippers (do i Need to explain this) (also fuck off if you think scott/cleo falls into this category because it doesn't. hashtag sceo)

## BEFORE YOU INTERACT / FRIEND:
- i'm often afk or offtab, so please whisper if you wanna talk! unless i'm actively in a conversation (in public chat).
- i get anxious around people and often go silent for extended periods of time. it's not because i dislike you or anything, i just don't know what to say.
- PLEASE interact i love talking to people. i just suck at it... unless my pony has a variant of dni and it doesn't apply to you (if i have DNIUF & you're a green name then u can still interact!)
- i prefer party chat or whispers, but i don't mind public! just general preference (also ponytown has such?? weird censoring. #Kicked for saying "beheading")
- i sometimes make sexual jokes, although only with like, close friends. if you're uncomfortable just bap me & i'll stop!
- i suck at typing and make mistakes (on purpose ANd accident). if this makes it hard to understand/is just annoying just tell me & i'll stop
- I LOVE CROWNS i love crowning & getting crowns. if i like your pony i WILL be crowning it. sorry if i don't respond tho! i just get awkward...
- i like to fuck around :tm: and by this i mean I Like Reading info. if you have a github or something linked to your pony i have probably clicked on it by the time you talk to me & read everything i could find. i love reading. my favorite activity. But Seriously i just, like knowing stuff before i interact!! not meant to be weird i just have shit memory and kind of need to :'3
- if it seems like i'm ignoring you i'm probably offtab or not at my laptop!!!! if i dislike you i will make that clear like right away. also i block/mute freely (i don't hide tho)

more will be added here as time goes on!
