martyns terribly long & messy github repository: pony town edition <br>
except its not really a pony town edition its just the default one <br>
made for pony town. so. technically pony town edition
***
## GENERAL INFO (i tried my best to simplify all this):
martyn, neil, or jeanine (in order of preference). any pronouns but i heavily prefer she/her & ae/aers. <br>
[thou/thee](https://pronouny.xyz/pronouns/601da3941d17f10013457879) instead of you/your is also funny and i like it. you don't need to use them tho <br>
my identity is very much a mess but to simply put it: i am a trans objectum lesboy freak <br>
bodily white & very much disabled. body age is n/a on account of i'm ant!

i'm both an introject (3rd life martyn) & the host of a (polyfragmented) system. <br>
i don't really care about 'doubles' or whatever and uhh. source talk (mostly) ok <- mcyt sp/interest <br>
i'm not always fronting so um . thumbs up! if you're not sure just bap (whisper) <br>
^ usually if a different github is linked (renchanting, thesunlandictwins) then its probably not me

uhhh I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO PUT HERE help. this is the general... gist of it.... shrugs

## "INTERACT WITH CAUTION" (not a dni list):
quick list! anything in parentheses are simple reasons why. IWC/ thin ice?? i guess. <br>
sorry if some of these seem petty. i'm a terribly petty person & hold grudges so easily </3
- doc fans (general dislike for him SORRY)
- DDVAU/double hearted fans (personal dislike & opinions on the comic, also that "all cops are beautiful" shit about hotguy) (fuck off if you were doing that!)
-  **heavy** scarian (scar/grian) shippers (bad experiences, just be normal please)
-  **heavy** ranchers (tango/jimmy) shippers (same as above)
-  flower husbands (scott/jimmy) shippers (bad experiences, also a lot of you are just. annoying. and fairly rude) (Not all of you just. a Loud minority)
-  anti joelshippers / lizzieshippers (I DO BOTH!! i just am not loud about it)
-  scott/pearl, scott/woman shippers (do i Need to explain this) (also fuck off if you think scott/cleo falls into this category because it doesn't. hashtag sceo)

## BEFORE YOU INTERACT / FRIEND:
- i'm often afk or offtab, so please whisper if you wanna talk! unless i'm actively in a conversation (in public chat).
- somewhat related to above, but i also sometimes have chat set to freinds/party/whispers, mostly due to getting overwhelmed (or distracted), so honestly whispering is your best bet!
- i get anxious around people and often go silent for extended periods of time. it's not because i dislike you or anything, i just. don't know what to say.
- PLEASE interact i love talking to people. i just suck at it... unless my pony has a variant of dni and it doesn't apply to you (if i have DNIUF & you're a green name then u can still interact!)
- i prefer party chat or whispers, but i don't mind public! just general preference (also ponytown has such?? weird censoring. #Kicked for saying "beheading")
- i sometimes make sexual jokes, although only with like, close friends. if you're uncomfortable just bap me & i'll stop!
- i suck at typing and make mistakes (on purpose ANd accident). if this makes it hard to understand/is just annoying just tell me & i'll stop
- I LOVE CROWNS i love crowning & getting crowns. if i like your pony i WILL be crowning it. sorry if i don't respond tho! i just get awkward...
- i like to fuck around :tm: and by this i mean I Like Reading info. if you have a github or something linked to your pony i have probably clicked on it by the time you talk to me & read everything i could find. i love reading. my favorite activity. But Seriously i just, like knowing stuff before i interact!! not meant to be weird i just have shit memory and kind of need to :'3
- if it seems like i'm ignoring you i'm probably offtab or not at my laptop!!!! if i dislike you i will make that clear like right away. also i block/mute freely (i don't hide tho)
- i get drained socially Very easily. i'm also disabled which plays a part in this. so sorry if i come off as dry sometimes!
- slightly related to above point, but if i'm acting drastically different but this github is linked it may or may not be my evil twin [hourglass](https://github.com/thesunlandictwins/alt.hourglass) (love it <3 my evil nefarious twin. NOT evil i just am a little jest i am joking!) because i'm. also part of a subsystem and co-consciousness and yada yada you get the idea. i might also just be feeling like shit at the time so like it might be me. might not be. mainly adding this because hex often doesn't change the social link

more will be added here as time goes on!
